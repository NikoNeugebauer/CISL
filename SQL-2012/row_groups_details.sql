Known Issues & Limitations: 

Modifications:

Changes in 1.2.0
	- Fixed bug with conVersion: 1.5.0, August 2017 to bigint for row_count
	+ Included support for the temporary tables with Columnstore Indexes (global & local)

Changes in 1.3.0
	+ Added compatibility support for the SQL Server 2016 internals information on Location, Row Group Trimming, Build Process, Vertipaq Optimisations, Sequential Generation Id, Closed DateTime & Creation DateTime
	+ Added 2 new compatibility parameters for filtering out the Min & Max Creation DateTimes

Changes in 1.5.0
	+ Added new parameter for the searching precise name of the object (@preciseSearch)
	+ Added new parameter for the identifying the object by its object_id (@objectId)
	+ Expanded search of the schema to include the pattern search with @preciseSearch = 0
