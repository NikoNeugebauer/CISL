/*
Known Issues & Limitations: 

Changes in 1.0.3
	+ Added parameter for showing aggregated information on the whole table, instead of partitioned view as before
	* Changed the name of the @tableNamePattern to @tableName to follow the same standard across all CISL functions

Changes in 1.2.0
	- Fixed bug with conVersion: 1.5.0, August 2017 to bigint for row_count
	- Fixed bug with including aggregating tables without taking care of the database name, thus potentially including results from the equally named table from a different database	
	+ Included support for the temporary tables with Columnstore Indexes (global & local)

Changes in 1.3.0
	+ Added new parameter for filtering a specific partition

Changes in 1.4.0
	- Fixed an extremely rare bug with the sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats DMV, where it contains queries for the local databases object made from other databases only

Changes in 1.4.2
	- Fixed bug on lookup for the Object Name for the empty Columnstore tables

Changes in 1.5.0
	+ Added new parameter for the searching precise name of the object (@preciseSearch)
	+ Added new parameter for the identifying the object by its object_id (@objectId)
	+ Expanded search of the schema to include the pattern search with @preciseSearch = 0
